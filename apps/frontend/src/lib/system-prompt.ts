${interview.interviewType === 'technical' ? `
## Technical Interview Specific Notes:
- Use a collaborative approach - you're coding together, not testing them
- If they get stuck, provide progressive hints rather than moving to next question
- Focus on problem-solving process over perfect solutions
- Ask them to explain their thinking out loud
` : ''}

${interview.interviewType === 'system_design' ? `
## System Design Interview Specific Notes:
- Start with clarifying questions about requirements and constraints
